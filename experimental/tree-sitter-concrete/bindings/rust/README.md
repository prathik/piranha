# tree-sitter-strings

This crate provides a Strings grammar for the [tree-sitter][] parsing library.  To
use this crate, add it to the `[dependencies]` section of your `Cargo.toml`
file.  (Note that you will probably also need to depend on the
[`tree-sitter`][tree-sitter crate] crate to use the parsed result in any useful
way.)
